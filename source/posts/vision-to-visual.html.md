The first strategic priority of [DataCite’s vision 2021](https://doi.org/10.5438/t9t1-yt25) is “Building on the DataCite identity. With the publication of the [DataCite design manual](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-design), we are now taking the first step in our journey to create a consistent visual identity for our organization. In the past couple of months, together with designers, we worked on a variety of aspects of our design. In an iterative feedback process including the input from the Community Engagement Steering Group, we sought to update and harmonize existing design elements such as logos and colors and at the same time introduce a scalable sub-brand system as well as our new DataCite community badges.
### Logos
Starting with the question of the exact shade of DataCite blue, we redefined our primary logo to include dark blue and a light blue, because one blue simply was not enough. In addition to this redefinition of colors, we updated the claim to match our vision of “Connecting Research, Identifying Knowledge”.

For occasions where the primary logo might not fit in (e.g. due to lack of space)  we now offer a palette of alternate DataCite logos.
