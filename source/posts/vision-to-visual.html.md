The first strategic priority of DataCite’s vision 2021 is “Building on the DataCite identity. With the publication of the DataCite design manual, we are now taking the first step in our journey to create a consistent visual identity for our organization. In the past couple of months, together with designers, we worked on a variety of aspects of our design. In an iterative feedback process including the input from the Community Engagement Steering Group, we sought to update and harmonize existing design elements such as logos and colors and at the same time introduce a scalable sub-brand system as well as our new DataCite community badges.
