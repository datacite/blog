On Tuesday the journal PLOS ONE celebrated its 10th anniversary ([blog post](http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/12/ten-years-of-advancing-science-as-one/) by PLOS ONE Editor-in-Chief Jörg Heber, [blog post](http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2016/12/20/the-ride-of-your-life-one-to-the-power-of-10/) by PLOS ONE Managing Editor Iratxe Puebla and PLOS Advocacy Director Catriona MacCallum). PLOS ONE (and PLOS) have changed scholarly publishing in many ways, from a DataCite perspective most importantly via the data policy [updated in February 2014](http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2014/02/24/plos-new-data-policy-public-access-data-2/) that states that

> PLOS journals require authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception.

PLOS ONE was not the first journal with a Joint Data Archiving Policy [@https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2010.11.006], but this policy update moved proper archiving in public repositories of data used in papers into the mainstream, given that PLOS ONE had become the largest journal in the world by number of papers published.

Publishing so many papers, and doing this only in electronic form, means that PLOS ONE doesn't really publish journal issues, but that papers are published daily as they become ready to be published. This means that the traditional way of referencing a scholarly article via journal name, volume, issue and page numbers isn't really working anymore, and PLOS ONE instead uses the publication year, month and an [electronic location identifier](https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/tag-library/1.1/element/elocation-id.html), for example *PLOS ONE*, 9(8), e105948. But of course we don't use this information to uniquely identify and locate a PLOS ONE article, we use the DOI instead – [https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0105948](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0105948) for this example.

This particular DOI is for an interesting article by Norris et al. [-@https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0105948] that describes how rocks in Death Valley slide with the help of thin layers of ice and wind, a phenomenon known since the 1940s, but in this paper for the first time systematically analyzed using GPS.

Before joining DataCite in 2015 I worked for PLOS for three years, helping with they Article-Level Metrics initiative [@https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001687]. The sliding rocks paper has been a fascinating ALM example, as the paper [drew a lot of attention](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/metrics?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0105948) beyond traditional citations.

But the sliding rocks paper has of course also been cited, and I counted 12 citations this week. These citations are listed below, together with what is shown in the reference list:

You can see something interesting in these references: only 4 in 12 include the DOI, only one reference includes a URL, but all 12 include the volume and 8 each include the issue and/or electronic location identifier. In other words, the references are formatted for a journal article that can be found as physical copy in a library, sorted and shelved by publication name, volume and issue. Only one in three references use a DOI and/or URL, even though that is the only way to fetch the article. Journal name, volume, issue and electronic location identifier also don't work too well in uniquely identifying the journal article, as this information is human-readable, but difficult for a machine to extract from the reference list. Many publishers of course link to referenced articles using the DOI despite not displaying the DOI, but that is a brittle implementation, as it for example doesn't allow authors to submit manuscripts that include DOIs in reference lists.

Reference lists remain one of the mysteries in scholarly publishing. Not only does this small example demonstrate that they still have not been fully adapted to how journal articles are published, read and cited in 2016, but you can also see that the different journals use different citation styles. There are [thousands of them](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles),  making it more difficult than needed to generate a citaion and to automate the extraction of citation information. Another mystery is the limitation of the number of references in an online only journal. While it makes sense to set some limit, these numbers sometimes seem arbitrarily low, coming from a time when every extra page printed was costly.

It seems unrealistic in the near future to ever agree on a common citation style. But what we can do is at least use a citation style that is widely used instead of reinventing one for every journal, and use a style that includes the DOI in the reference. PLOS switched from a PLOS-specific style to the Vancouver or NLM style [@https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7256] in 2015. This style is widely used by biomedical journals, but still recommends a traditional style of referencing:

![The general format for a reference to a journal article, taken from [@https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7256]](/images/2016/12/ch1e1.jpg)

The DOI can optionally be included in the reference, but journals don't always do that. The Sliding Rocks PLOS ONE paper was published in 2014 with the old PLOS citation style and without DOIs in the references, a 2015 PLOS ONE paper [@https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0134826] shows the new style and inclusion of the DOI in the references.

This blog uses the [APA style](http://www.apastyle.org/), a style that is not only widely used and documented, but also includes DOIs in references (as you can see below), and is one of the few citation styles with [specific support for data citations](http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2013/12/how-to-cite-a-data-set-in-apa-style.html) (adding *[Data set]* after the title).

Using journal name, volume, issue and page numbers in a reference poses a particular challenge for DataCite, as the DataCite metadata schema doesn't support them. The main reasons for this are the focus of DataCite on providing metadata for datasets, and that the DataCite metadata schema is based on [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-citation-guidelines/), which also doens't have these properties ([bibliographicCitation](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#bibliographicCitation) can be used instead). More than 1.5 million text documents have been registered with a DataCite DOI, and many of them have journal name, volume, issue and pages information. Should we add support for these properties to the DataCite metadata schema, or should we see these properties as no longer essential for citation information in a reference and leave them out of the metadata schema? I would argue that resources that have a digital object identifier don't require this information to uniquely identify and/or locate the resource.

The other challenge for DataCite is that the current state of reference lists in journal articles makes it harder than needed to include data citations in them. When DOIs are not included in reference lists since the citation style doesn't want them displayed, then manuscripts with data citations submitted by authors need special treatment, which limits adoption because of the extra effort required. Publishers routinely rebuild reference lists from scratch by fetching the DOI and associated metadata based on the citation information provided, and these tools are built around citation metadata typically found in journal articles (again including volume, issue and page information) and Crossref DOIs.

The conclusion from the above is simple: **As a publisher, require a citation style that includes the DOI.**

The X-Files is an American TV series about FBI special agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully who investigate marginalized, unsolved cases involving paranormal phenomena. And in an episode aired in February 2016, they referred to PLOS ONE Sliding Rocks paper:

>  Scully, since we've been away, much of the "unexplained" has been explained. The "Death Valley Racetrack"? Turns out it was just ice formations, moving the rocks around as it melted. Yeah, ice.

Fox Mulder in [The X-Files: Mulder & Scully Meet the Were-Monster](https://doi.org/10.5240/68D6-DD1B-C9D5-AE84-9A9E-2), via [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4549942/quotes).

To refer to this episode you can again use [a DOI](https://doi.org/10.5240/68D6-DD1B-C9D5-AE84-9A9E-2), which in this case is not for scholarly content but an [EIDR](http://eidr.org/) – A universal unique identifier for movie and television assets. And now we have come full circle.
