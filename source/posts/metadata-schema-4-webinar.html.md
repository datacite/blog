The DataCite Metadata Schema 4.0 comes with improvements to name identifiers, funding information, resource types, and other modifications. These changes are important in improving data discoverability and reusability, and helps to grant proper credit to data creators.

Joan Starr, California Digital Library and co-chair of the Metadata Working group, and Martin Fenner, Technical Director, DataCite, covered the changes to the schema and how they will improve data sharing. Over the summer early adopters will help test the new schema and its final version will be launched this fall.

If you could not attend last week or you want to review the session, the recording of the webinar is available:
