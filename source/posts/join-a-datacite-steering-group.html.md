DataCite is a membership and community organization and we encourage involvement from people that share our vision. To help guide and support our growth and ongoing development, DataCite has two Steering Groups: the Services and Technology Steering Group and the Community Engagement Steering Group. Our Steering Groups provide a venue for participation by interested community members and help us with priority setting and identify strategies related to sustainability planning, services, and outreach.

We are happy to announce that we currently have an open call for nominations for new steering group members! Representatives from member organizations can apply to join one of the groups to advise and support DataCite. We also have open seats for non-members that bring new expertise to the groups. Steering Group members will be chosen based on their specific expertise. We strive for diversity and are therefore looking to include members from different regions, genders, backgrounds, and types of organizations.

### Services and Technology Steering Group
The STSG is responsible for providing expertise and advice on DataCite’s open source and service development. The group is involved in suggesting and reviewing technical approaches and services to evaluate their impact and effectiveness. The STSG aligns its work with the Community Engagement Steering Group (CESG) so that technology and services are aligned with DataCite’s community engagement efforts. We are currently calling for three technology experts in the community to serve on the STSG. We are looking to improve regional diversity of the STSG group, so we encourage experts from South America, Africa and Asia regions to apply. You can find more information about the existing members at [https://datacite.org/steering.html](https://datacite.org/steering.html) and the Terms of Reference at [https://datacite.org/documents/STSG_ToR.pdf](https://datacite.org/documents/STSG_ToR.pdf).

### Community Engagement Steering Group
The CESG is responsible for identifying outreach needs for the DataCite community. This includes: monitoring and assessing community needs and providing feedback on DataCite’s priorities and services; recommending strategies and tools to communicate about DataCite’s services, features, and plans; helping to build relationships, cultivate discussions and promote collaboration among the DataCite community; and involvement in DataCite’s annual meetings. The CESG aligns its work with the Services and Technology Steering Group so that activities support DataCite’s services and products. The CESG works with three regional Expert Groups: the Americas EG, the APAC EG and the EMEA EG.

We currently have an open call for new members for the Community Engagement Steering Group itself, as well as for all three Expert Groups. The CESG focuses more on strategic questions and consists mainly of community and engagement professionals, whereas the Expert Groups are more hands-on and grounded in regional activities. If you are uncertain which group would be the best fit for you, please feel free to tick multiple boxes and we can discuss the options with you.

We are looking to increase regional diversity, so we specifically encourage experts from South America, the Middle East, Africa and Asia to apply. You can find more information about the existing members at [https://datacite.org/steering.html](https://datacite.org/steering.html) and the Terms of Reference at [https://datacite.org/documents/CESG_ToR.pdf](https://datacite.org/documents/CESG_ToR.pdf).

### Application process
The call for applications for the STSG (https://forms.gle/GAYLj6AKruPewjTo8) and for the CESG (https://forms.gle/W3v14VFTnFBWVHyR7) is open starting today.
