The Org ID Working Group has put our time and energy into defining requirements for an open organization identifier and outlining a path forward for launching a project for our communities to leverage. As the working group chair, I wanted to provide an update on our initiative and let you know where our efforts are headed. 

Last time our group met—at the stakeholder meeting in January 2018 in Girona—ORCID, DataCite, and Crossref were tasked with drafting a proposal that meets our Working Group’s requirements for a community-led, organizational identifier registry. 

### Community-led effort
I would like to summarize all of the work that has gone into this project, a truly community-driven initiative, over the last two years:

* A series of collaborative workshops were held at the Coalition for Networked Information (CNI) meeting in San Antonio TX (2016), the FORCE11 conference in Portland OR (2016), and at PIDapalooza in Reykjavik (2017).
* Findings from these workshops were summarized in three documents, which we made openly available to the community for public comment:
* Organization Identifier Project: A Way Forward (PDF)
Organization Identifier Provider Landscape (PDF)
Technical Considerations for an Organization Identifier Registry (PDF)
* A [Working Group](https://orcid.org/content/organization-identifier-working-group) worked throughout 2017 and voted to approve a set of recommendations and principles for ‘governance’ and ‘product’:

* [Governance Recommendations](https://figshare.com/articles/ORG_ID_WG_Governance_Principles_and_Recommendations/5402002/1)
* [Product Principles and Recommendations](https://figshare.com/articles/ORG_ID_WG_Product_Principles_and_Recommendations/5402047/1)
* We then put out a [Request for Information](https://doi.org/10.23640/07243.5458162.v1) that sought expressions of interest from organizations to be involved in implementing and running an organization identifier registry.
* There was a really good response to the RFI and reviewing the responses and thinking about next steps led to our most recent [stakeholder meeting in Girona](https://orcid.org/content/2018-org-id-meeting) in January 2018.

### The work already invested

I want to thank everyone that made these efforts productive. It’s been two fruitful years with a lot of time and expertise volunteered. We truly had the support of the community with representatives from Alfred P. Sloan Foundation; American Physical Society, California Digital Library, Cornell University, Crossref, DataCite, Digital Science, Editeur, Elsevier, Foundation for Earth Sciences, Hindawi, Jisc, ORCID, Ringgold, Springer Nature, The IP Registry, and U.S. Geological Survey involved throughout this initiative. And we couldn't have done it without the help and guidance of our consultants Helen Szigeti and Kristen Ratan.

### The way forward

Since our last stakeholder meeting, discussions to build out different options have continued, and have led to a new and clear way forward. I’m excited to let everyone know that the product recommendations will be turned into a new start-up phase, with details to be announced very soon. 
 
Our initiative will move on in an agile and flexible way, governance-wise. The initiative leadership group has secured start-up resourcing and is building a launch plan. While the ORCID team has decided not to continue in a leadership role on this project, both DataCite and Crossref have formalized their commitments and are hoping that all members of our initiative will continue to support the next phase of our work.  
 
Look for announcements in the coming weeks about how to get involved. As always, we will welcome your feedback and involvement as this effort continues. Please contact me directly with any questions or comments at [john.chodacki@ucop.edu](john.chodacki@ucop.edu).  
 
Thanks again for your help bringing an open organization identifier registry to fruition!
