The DataCite Metadata Working Group has prepared a DataCite to Dublin Core application profile (DC2AP) and would love to hear your comments about it!

![DataCite loves Dublin Core](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CbgPvGaWAAAdDSw.png)

The profile will help you building Dublin Core compatible DataCite metadata records, using Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) metadata terms and other ontologies. Along with the DC2AP, we are also releasing a DataCite Ontology.READMORE

The Metadata Working Group seeks public review as the first step to become a DCMI Community Specification. Feedback from potential users and developers is strongly encouraged. It will help us improving the interoperability and quality of DataCite's metadata.

Please visit [https://groups.google.com/a/datacite.org/forum/#!forum/dc2map](https://groups.google.com/a/datacite.org/forum/#!forum/dc2map) to review the documents and post your comments.

Many thanks in advance!
