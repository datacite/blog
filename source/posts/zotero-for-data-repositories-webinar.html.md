On May 17, 2016, DataCite continued our monthly webinar series with Sebastian Karcher, Associate Director of the [Qualitative Data Repository](https://qdr.syr.edu/) (QDR) at Syracuse University, presenting on Zotero for data repositories.  Sebastian is an expert in scholarly referencing and citation workflows and has been a longtime contributor to the Citation Style Language as well as Zotero, the open source reference management software.READMORE

Sebastian provided insights in how Zotero can be used to fetch metadata from data repositories and demonstrated how repositories can aid integration with reference managers such as Zotero. Example repositories included [Dataverse](http://dataverse.org/), the [Dryad Digital Repository](http://datadryad.org/), the [UK Data Service](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/), and the Qualitative Data Repository.

If you want to put these ideas into practice to improve your data repository integration, we uploaded the video recording of the session!

Also, the slides are available (and citable!) on Figshare [@https://doi.org/10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.3364708.V1] and the code snippets on [Github](https://github.com/adam3smith/zotero-workshops/tree/master/data-translators).

During the discussion the article ‘Achieving human and machine accessibility of cited data in scholarly publications’ [@https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.1] was mentioned, as well as the [Force11 Data Citation Implementation Pilot - Repository Early Adopters](https://www.force11.org/group/dcip/eg4repository) group. Finally, if you want to learn more about Citoid and Zotero, please see the [Automated citations in Wikipedia: Citoid and the technology behind it](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Citoid/Zotero%27s_Tech_Talk).
