The inaugural meeting of the DataCite re3data Working Group was convened in Paris on September 20th at the offices of the International Council for Science (ICSU). Co-chairs Michael Witt and Frank Scholze gave the background and history of Databib, which was initially funded by the IMLS in the United States, and [re3data.org](http://service.re3data.org/search/results), which has been funded by DFG in Germany. Both projects shared the same vision - to build a registry to help users and applications find and use appropriate research data repositories - and so they merged together to combine their expertise, database, software, and processes under the auspices of [DataCite](https://www.datacite.org/services/find-repository.html).READMORE

Monthly web meetings of the working group are open to all DataCite members, and items can be added to its agenda by contacting any member of the group. Regular updates from the group will also be shared during DataCite’s monthly Open Hours. The group is in the process of migrating its wiki, blog, and mailing lists to DataCite’s infrastructure. Completing the transition to DataCite by the end of the year and exploring new opportunities and synergies will be the focus of the group in the coming months.

Members of the working group are Frank Scholze (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology), Michael Witt (Purdue University), Mustapha Mokrane, (ICSU/World Data System), Robert Ulrich (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology), Rachael Kotarski (British Library), Martin Fenner (DataCite), Roland Bertelmann (GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences), and Maxi Kindling (Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin).

Looking ahead, Paul Vierkant (GFZ) will be presenting the current status of the DFG-funded work and latest developments with re3data.org in a webinar on December 3, 11:00-11:30 CET. The webinar is free, and no registration is required. For more information, visit [http://bit.ly/1LnRKOg](http://bit.ly/1LnRKOg).
